We live in a big house with a huge garden. We can offer a couch but it is in the livingroom. If you need to work I can introduce you to my coworking space.\nDonâ€™t expect not to eat with us (good wines goes with good food !). I strongly recommend summer periods where we spend most of our evening outside in the garden doing barbecues or planchas.\nThere is an atelier with lots of tools and all you need to solder (electronics but also metal, I made my own bike there.)\nThe wifi is shity.</p>\n"}
