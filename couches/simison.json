Often Iâ€™ve hitchhiked, cycled or hiked a mountain.</p>\n\n<p>Iâ€™m a thinker, maker &amp; activist. I like making stuff, be it from wood, electronics or code.</p>\n\n<p>Iâ€™m a techie working at <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a>. As a hobby, I build open source &amp; non-profit <a href=\"https://www.mikaelkorpela.fi/volunteering/\">travel projects</a> (I co-founded <a href=\"https://www.trustroots.org/team\">Trustroots</a> and Iâ€™m also behind <a href=\"https://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page\">Hitchwiki</a>, <a href=\"https://nomadwiki.org/en/Main_Page\">Nomadwiki</a> and <a href=\"https://trashwiki.org/en/Main_Page\">Trashwiki</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I enjoy a company of positive and talkative people.\nDonâ€™t be evil. Be yourself.</p>\n\n<p>I have a good tolerance for different people and behaviour.\nYou can be odd if you want to.</p>\n\n<p>I live with <a href=\"https://photos.wanderlust.lt/\">Simona</a> and our two kiddos.</p>\n\n<p>Weâ€™re often out of Vilnius and we donâ€™t plan much ahead; I donâ€™t usually know what are my plans many weeks ahead. Last minute messages are great!</p>\n\n<p>Weâ€™re often heading out to the countryside on the weekends.</p>\n\n<p>I love cycling, sauna, inspiring music and I have high respect for good, fresh food.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mikaelkorpela.fi/\">www.mikaelkorpela.fi</a></p>\n\n<p>See ya! ðŸ‘‹</p>\n"}
