In Brussels we've level up'd an empty house (not squatted, but in a temporary legal occupation).

There's a floor for sleeping, with mattresses. A hacklab with couches, MPD, screen, ..

Then downstairs is the bicycle workshop and general workshop in the making.

Personally into DIY hosting and decentralized internet / mesh at the moment. And organizing cryptoparties.

If you come you can make a double of the key so you can be autonomous.
