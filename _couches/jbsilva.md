I live by myself in a small apartment near the city centre. It's located in the
main avenue of the city (Avenida São Carlos) and there is a bus stop right in
front of the building.

I have a couch and an extra mattress, but I prefer to host only one person at a
time as there is not much space. Wifi (8 Mb/s) works fine.

I can show you around and do some more stuff depending on my time.
